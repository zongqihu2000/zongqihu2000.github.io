Education
======
* Bachelor Degree in Shanghai, The East China University of Science and Technology, 2018-2022
* Master Degree in Hong Kong, The University of Hong Kong, 2022-2024 (expected)


Project experience
======
* 2022.09 - 2023.08: Complete individually
  * Design a Neural Network to Substitute Quadruped Robots' Kinematic System
  * Duties included: Use Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to replace the kenematic system of legged robots     and the results show that the deep learning method could substitute that very well when the robot stands still and walks.
           
  
* 2023.03 - 2023.05: Leader
  * Short-term Hightway Tranffic Flow Prediction Model Considering Weather and Spatial-temporal Characteristics
